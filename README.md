## Notable Features
+ [Automatic code documentation](#Documentation)

## Dependencies
+ LabVIEW 2019 with 2020 FRC Updates

## Robot Configuration
There are configurations for "Competition", "Practice", "Programming", and "Demo" chassis.  To select which to use, create a file named "/home/lvuser/RobotID" on the RoboRIO and create a line with one of the chassis names only.  If there are any non-whitespace characters before or after the robot ID, the configuration will default to "Competition".  If multiple lines have valid robot IDs, the first will be used.
